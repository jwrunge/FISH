        <p><strong>FISH of Galesburg</strong> is an emergency food pantry which has been helping to feed the hungry of Knox County since 1970. The mission of <strong>FISH</strong> is to provide food for those in need.</p>
        <p><strong>FISH</strong> focuses on providing emergency food relief for hunger. It is our hope that the food made available to those in need will result in better health and quality of life.</p>
        <p>Food items distributed include non-perishable and frozen foods as well as vouchers for milk and eggs to individuals and families who contact the pantry for assistance.</p>

        <h2>How FISH helps</h2>
        <p class='factoid floatable rounded'><span class='emph'>Each year, 17,000-18,000 individuals receive food from <strong>FISH of Galesburg</strong></span></p>
        <p>Calls for food assistance come to <strong>FISH</strong> through a telephone answering service. These calls are then relayed to pantry volunteers Monday through Friday between the hours of 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. A volunteer from the pantry will return the call and ask a few necessary questions in order to determine the size of the family for whom assistance is being requested.</p>
        <p><strong>FISH</strong> seeks to provide enough food to support an individual or family for a three-to-four-day period of time. Persons contacting the pantry may receive food assistance once every thirty (30) days.</p>
    
        <a name='volunteer'><h2>How people help FISH</h2></a>
        <p>FISH depends on the donation of nonperishable food items as well as monetary donations from individuals, churches, local civic organizations, and businesses.</p>
        <p><strong>All FISH workers are volunteers.</strong> There is minimal administrative expense. On average, 94% of funds expended are used to feed the hungry.</p>
